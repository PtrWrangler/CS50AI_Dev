Heredity
Write an AI to assess the likelihood that a person will have a particular genetic trait.


name, mother, father, trait (CSVs)
- trait field is empty then we dont know if they have it


Every single person carries 2 versions of the GJB2 gene
	meaning every person has the potential to carry 0, 1, or 2 of the hearing impairemnet (mutated) gene
	no matter how many copies of the mutated or not mutated gene you have you can still be either impaired or not impaired
	
If a parent has 2 copies of the mutated gene, then it is passed to the child.
If a parent has 1 copy   of the mutated gene, then it is a prob 0.5 that it is passed to the child.
If a parent has 0 copies of the mutated gene, then it is passed notto the child.
There is still a small probability of additional mutation.
